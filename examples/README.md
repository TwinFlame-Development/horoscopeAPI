# TwinFlame - The Horoscope API

> API programmers, the stars predict that these sample code snippets
> will be your ally today, but be careful not to rely too heavily on
> their power nor syntax - ultimately, you must take charge of your own
> implementation. Don't worry, though, for the wisdom of the API
> documentation will guide you towards the light. Remember to
> double-check the parameters, as using the wrong ones can cause
> unintended consequences. May your day be as productive as a successful
> API integration, and may your code be as reliable as a trusted sample
> snippet, but beware of their limitations!

Please note that the code examples provided here are intended to serve
as a starting point for your own development efforts and may need to be
adapted to work within the specifics of your unique environment.

Please use these examples at your own discretion and always test
thoroughly before deploying to a production environment.

We recommend exercising the API using
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a similar tool to become familiar
with its functionality before implementing it in your application.

<div class="contents" depth="2">

We've put together examples/starters for:

</div>

The following examples use these parameters:

<table> 
 <tr>
   <th>Parameter</th>
   <th>Required</th>
   <th>Value</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>‘date’</td>
   <td>Yes</td>
   <td>04-01-2023</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>‘sign’</td>
   <td>Yes</td>
   <td>scorpio</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>‘token’</td>
   <td>Yes</td>
   <td>mmEUtLATc8w_UNnHuR2</td>
 </tr>

 </table>

All examples referece the hosted test endpoint, and pass 'token' as a
Bearer Token:

<table> 
 <tr>
   <th>Method</th>
   <th>URL</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>POST</td>
   <td>https://us-central1-tf-natal.cloudfunctions.net/horoscopeapi_test</td>
 </tr>

 </table>

## cURL

> You're feeling creative and inspired today. This is a great time to
> use cURL to solve problems in new and interesting ways. You may also
> want to consider writing a cURL script to automate a task that you do
> on a regular basis.

``` python
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mmEUtLATc8w_UNnHuR2" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sign":"scorpio", "day":"04-01-2023"}' \
  https://us-central1-tf-natal.cloudfunctions.net/horoscopeapi_test
```

## Python

> Python programmers, the stars predict that your code will be as clean

``` python
import requests
import json

def tfhoro(sign, day, token):
    url = 'https://us-central1-tf-natal.cloudfunctions.net/horoscopeapi_test'
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
    }
    data = {
        'sign': sign,
        'day': day
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        responseData = json.loads(response.content)
        return responseData
    else:
        print('Error: HTTP %d' % response.status_code)

ObjData = tfhoro('scorpio', '04-01-2023', 'mmEUtLATc8w_UNnHuR2')
print(ObjData)
```

## Node.js

> Greetings, Node.js programmers! Today, the stars predict that your
> code will be as performant as a Java application, but be careful not
> to let your asynchronous programming skills rust. Don't worry, though,
> for the power of Node's event-driven architecture will guide you
> towards success. Remember to close your streams, as leaking resources
> can cause issues. May your day be as smooth as a cup of Java (coffee)!

``` javascript
var request = require('request');

var options = {
  url: 'https://us-central1-tf-natal.cloudfunctions.net/horoscopeapi_test?token=mmEUtLATc8w_UNnHuR2&sign=scorpio&date=04-01-2023',
  method: 'GET'
};

function callback(error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
      console.log(body);
  }
}

request(options, callback);
```

Wix Velo ^^^^^^^ Wix Velo programmers, the stars predict that your code
will be as beautiful as a website designed by a professional today, but
be careful not to get lost in the vastness of the Wix platform. Don't
worry, though, for the power of Velo's drag-and-drop interface will
guide you towards the path of least resistance. Remember to use the
correct scope, as calling a variable outside of its boundaries can cause
confusion. May your day be as colorful as the customizable design
options of a Wix website!

``` javascript
import {fetch} from 'wix-fetch';

function getJsonData(token, date, sign) {
    const url = 'https://us-central1-tf-natal.cloudfunctions.net/horoscopeapi_test';
    const options = {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({date, sign})
    };
    return fetch(url, options)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(jsonData => {
            console.log(jsonData);
            return jsonData;
        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.error('Error fetching JSON data:', err);
        });
}

getJsonData('mmEUtLATc8w_UNnHuR2', '04-01-2023', 'scorpio')
    .then(jsonData => {
        console.log(jsonData);
        // Do something with the jsonData object here
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error('Error getting JSON data:', err);
    });
```

WordPress HTTP API ^^^^^^^

> WordPress programmers, the stars predict that your code will be as
> versatile as a Swiss Army knife today, but be warned of the cosmic
> forces that may cause issues with the HTTP API. Don't worry, though,
> for the power of WordPress's robust community will guide you towards

> on a WordPress site, and may your HTTP requests be as smooth as
> butter!

``` php
$args = array(
    'headers' => array(
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer mmEUtLATc8w_UNnHuR2',
        'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
    ),
    'body' => json_encode(array(
        'sign' => 'scorpio',
        'day' => '04-01-2023'
    ))

React Native ^^^^^^^ React Native programmers, the stars predict that
your code will be as responsive as ever today, but beware of unexpected
UI changes that may throw off your design. The universe advises you to
stay calm and use the power of hot reloading to make quick adjustments.
Don't forget to test your app on multiple devices, as compatibility
issues may arise. May your day be as smooth as the performance of your
React Native app!

``` javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const HoroscopeAPI = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {

jQuery Ajax ^^^^^^ Attention all jQuery Ajax programmers! Today, the
stars predict that your requests will be successful, but be warned of
the cosmic delays that may occur due to poor network connectivity. Don't
fret, though, for the power of asynchronous programming will guide you
towards the path of enlightenment. Remember to handle your error
callbacks, as unexpected responses may cause frustration. May your day
be as seamless as your jQuery Ajax requests!

``` javascript
function tfhoro(sign, day, token) {

   dataType: 'json'
 });
}

tfhoro('scorpio', '04-01-2023', 'mmEUtLATc8w_UNnHuR2')
 .done(function(responseData) {
   console.log(responseData);
 })
